Welcome to my website!
I am a PhD candidate in political science at the [DYNAMICS graduate school](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/about), which is jointly organised by Humboldt University and the Hertie school. There, I am supervised by [Heike Klüver](http://www.heike-kluever.com/).

I am interested in political behaviour with a focus in the relationship between political elites and voters as well as on the politics of the environment. My dissertation looks at how parties react to shocks in voters’ preferences, how policies can influence inequalities in representation, and how voters react to changes in the composition and the behaviour of political elites. 

I study these questions in established democracies, applying causal inference methods and using observational and geospatial data. I have a backgorund in social psychology that informs how I think about political phenomena.
