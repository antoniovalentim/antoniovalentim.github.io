**About**  
  
Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor in European Politics and Policy at the [London School of Economics and Political Science](https://www.lse.ac.uk/). Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at the [MacMillan Center](https://macmillan.yale.edu/), [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/), received my PhD in political science at the [DYNAMICS graduate school](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics), jointly organised by [Humboldt University Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en) and the [Hertie school](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) and was a visiting scholar at [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/). I am affiliated with the [Humboldt Governance Lab](https://hu-govlab.de/en/homepage/) and held visiting positions at [Sciences Po](https://www.sciencespo.fr/en/) and [IESP-UERJ](https://iesp.uerj.br/).

I study comparative and environmental politics, focusing on political behaviour and political elites in established democracies. The core of my research seeks to answer two questions: 1. When and why do voters change their opinions and behaviours regarding climate change? and 2. How do political incentives influence political elites' behaviour on climate change? In addition to these questions, I am also interested in gender and representation. Some of my work has been published or conditionally accepted at the *American Journal of Political Science*, *British Journal of Political Science* and *Nature Climate Change*.

I study these questions using econometric tools, survey experiments and interviews. Prior to my PhD, I obtained a BA (University of Coimbra) and an MSc (London School of Economics) in (social) psychology that inform how I think about political phenomena.
