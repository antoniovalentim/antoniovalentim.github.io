# About Me  
  
I am a PhD candidate in political science at the [DYNAMICS graduate school](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/about), which is jointly organised by [Humboldt University Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en) and the [Hertie school](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/). In 2022, I will be a visiting scholar at [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/).

I am interested in political behaviour, with a focus on the politics of the environment as well as the relationship between political elites and voters. My dissertation, which is supervised by [Heike Klüver](http://www.heike-kluever.com/), looks at how climate change, its politicisation and climate policies influence the behaviour of voters and of political elites.

<!-- how both voters and political elites react to climate change and the politicisation of the environment, as well as the consequences of environmental policy. --> 

I study these questions in established democracies, applying causal inference methods using observational and geospatial data. Prior to starting my PhD, I obtained a BA (University of Coimbra) and an MSc (London School of Economics) in (social) psychology that inform how I think about political phenomena.
