**About**  
  
Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the [MacMillan Center](https://macmillan.yale.edu/), [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/). Before that, I received my PhD in political science at the [DYNAMICS graduate school](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics), jointly organised by [Humboldt University Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en) and the [Hertie school](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) and was a visiting scholar at [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/). In September 2024, I will join the London School of Economics and Political Science as an Assistant Professor in European Politics and Policy.

I study comparative and environmental politics, focusing on political behaviour and political elites in established democracies. The core of my research seeks to answer two questions: 1. When and why do voters change their opinions and behaviours regarding climate change? and 2. How do political incentives influence political elites' behaviour on climate change? In addition to these questions, I am also interested in gender and representation. Some of this work is conditionally accepted at *Nature Climate Change*.

I study these questions using econometric tools, survey experiments and interviews. Prior to my PhD, I obtained a BA (University of Coimbra) and an MSc (London School of Economics) in (social) psychology that inform how I think about political phenomena.
