**About**  
  
Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Associate at [Yale](https://www.yale.edu/). Before that, I earned my PhD in political science at the [DYNAMICS graduate school](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/about), jointly organised by [Humboldt University Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en) and the [Hertie school](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) and was a visiting scholar at [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/). 

The core of my research studies when and how voters and political elites act on climate, and how these groups influence one another. More specifically, I study how both voters and political elites react to climate change and the politicisation of the environment, as well as the consequences of environmental policy. I am also interested in gender, minority politics and representation.

I study these questions in established democracies, applying causal inference methods on observational and geospatial data. Prior to my PhD, I obtained a BA (University of Coimbra) and an MSc (London School of Economics) in (social) psychology that inform how I think about political phenomena.
