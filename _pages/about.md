Welcome to my website!
I am a PhD candidate in political science at the [DYNAMICS graduate school](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/about), which is jointly organised by Humboldt University and the Hertie school.

I am interested in political behaviour with a focus in the relationship between political elites and voters as well as on the politics of the environment. My dissertation, which is supervised by [Heike Klüver](http://www.heike-kluever.com/), looks at how parties react to shocks in voters’ preferences, how policies can influence inequalities in representation, and how voters react to changes in the composition and the behaviour of political elites. 

I study these questions in established democracies, applying causal inference methods and using observational and geospatial data. Prior to starting my PhD, I obtained a BA (University of Coimbra) and an MSc (London School of Economics) in (social) psychology that inform how I think about political phenomena.


On this website, you can find more information on my [research](http://antoniovalentim.github.io/research/), my [teaching experience](http://antoniovalentim.github.io/teaching/), on [datasets](http://antoniovalentim.github.io/data/) I collected, and you can download my [CV](/files/AValentim_CV_website.pdf).

If you are interested in knowing more about any of these projects or think we have similar interests, please feel free to contact me at [antonio.valentim@hu-berlin.de](mailto:antonio.valentim@hu-berlin.de).
