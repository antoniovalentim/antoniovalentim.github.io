Welcome to my website!
I am a PhD candidate in political science at the [DYNAMICS graduate school](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/en/dynamics/about), which is jointly organised by Humboldt University and the Hertie school. There, I am supervised by [Heike Klüver](http://www.heike-kluever.com/).

I am interested in political behaviour with a focus in the relationship between political elites and voters and the politics of the environment. In my dissertation, I study how parties react to shocks in voters’ preferences, how policies can influence inequalities in representation, and how voters react to changes in the composition and the behaviour of political elites. I study these questions in established democracies and applying causal inference methods with observational and geospatial data.

On this website, you can find more information on my [research](http://www.valentimantonio.com/research/), my [teaching experience](http://antoniovalentim.github.io/teaching/), and you can see my [CV](http://antoniovalentim.github.io/cv/).

If you are interested in knowing more about any of these projects or think we have similar interests, please feel free to contact me at [antonio.valentim@hu-berlin.de](mailto:antonio.valentim@hu-berlin.de).
